# Deployment

## Front
Simply run `pnpm install` to get started and install all the dependencies.
If you do not have `pnpm` run `npm install -g pnpm` to install it.

Then run `ng build --configuration production` followed by `ng serve` to launch the app
ALternatively, you can use `ng deploy` to deploy the app wherever you want.
